#KASELL

A project for extracting scores from videos of video games.
Named in honor of Carl Kasell of "Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me..." fame.

##REQUIREMENTS

###For this script:
* python3
* pytesseract
* PIL

###Other things needed to actually make use of this script:
* ffmpeg
* youtube-dl

##USAGE

Not suggested at all :)  It literally does one thing right now and needs further work.

But first you'd need to use ffmpeg to extract your video to a series of
.png files.  You may also need to use youtube-dl to actually get said
video.
